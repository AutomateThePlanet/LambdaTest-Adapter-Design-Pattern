:question: **What is this Repository About?**
This tutorial delves into the essential templates of design patterns in software development, specifically focusing on the Proxy and Adapter patterns in automated testing. These patterns are instrumental for enhancing the functionalities of web drivers and making automated testing more robust and maintainable. Through this tutorial, you'll discover how these patterns act as guidelines to solve common design problems, simplify complex logic, and extend functionalities without altering existing code.

**What Will You Learn?**
- **Understanding Design Patterns in Automated Testing:** Explore the basics of design patterns and their importance in solving common design problems in software development.
- **Proxy Pattern for Automated Testing:** Learn how the Proxy pattern acts as an intermediary to control access to objects like `IWebDriver`, adding functionalities such as automatic waits for elements to become visible or clickable.
- **Adapter Pattern for Extending Functionalities:** Discover how the Adapter pattern changes the interface of a class, like `IWebElement`, to match what's needed. This includes extending capabilities with custom methods such as 'Hover()', 'Focus()', or 'WaitForAjax()'.

### Steps to Run Tests Locally in Visual Studio with C#

1. **Open the Project:** Launch Visual Studio and open your C# project.

2. **Run Tests:**
   - **Single Test Method:** Right-click on the test method name > `Run Tests`.
   - **All Tests in a Test Class:** Right-click on the test class file > `Run Tests`.

### Running Tests on LambdaTest

To execute tests on LambdaTest, you need to set up environment variables in your Visual Studio test configurations:

- `LT_USERNAME` with your LambdaTest username.
- `LT_ACCESS_KEY` with your LambdaTest access key.

### Configuring Test Settings in Visual Studio

1. **Access Test Settings:** Navigate to `Test` > `Configure Run Settings` > `Select Solution Wide runsettings File` for broader configurations or use the `Test Explorer` context menu for specific settings.
2. **Set Environment Variables:** In your `.runsettings` file or through the Test Explorer context menu, add your LambdaTest credentials.
   - Include `<EnvironmentVariables>` in your `.runsettings` file with `LT_USERNAME` and `LT_ACCESS_KEY` values.

### Viewing Test Results

Test results are available in the `Test Explorer` window, providing information on passed and failed tests, execution times, and detailed error messages.
